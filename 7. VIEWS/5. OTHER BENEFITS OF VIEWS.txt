-- OTHER BENEFITS OF VIEWS

   -- AS YOU CAN SEE , VIEWS CAN HELP US SIMPLIFYING QUERIES
   -- VIEWS CAN REDUCE THE IMPACT OF CHANGES TO YOUR DB DESIGN 
			-- IMAGINE YOU HAVE 10 QUERIES WRITTEN ON INVOICES TABLE 
            -- AND YOU HAVE TO ADD/DELETE THE COL OF THE TABLE
            -- YOU HAVE TO ADD COLS TO DIFFERENT COLUMN
            -- AND YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE CHANGE TO ANY TABLE
            -- WHAT WILL HAPPEN AT THAT SITUATION, WE SHOULD USE VIEWS
            -- WE SHOULD MODIFY OUR VIEW CODE AND USE ALIAS TO USE THEIR ORIGINAL NAME IN THE TABLE
            -- OR IF WE MOVE THE COLS TO DIFF TABLE LIKE JOINING THE INVOICES TABLE WITH ANOTHER TABLE
            -- ONLY THING GONNA CHANGE IS THE VIEW NOT THE TABLE
            -- IF OUR QUERIES ARE BASED ON THE VIEWS THIS IS NOT GOING TO AFFECT THE UNDERLYING TABLE
	
    -- RESTRICT ACCESS TO THE DATA IN THE UNDERLYING TABLE
	    -- FOR eg IF WE USE FILTER(WHERE CLAUSE) TO THE VIEWS 
            -- IT WILL ONLY RETURN THE RECORDS WHICH ARE IN THE VIEWS 
            -- DATA WHICH IS IN TABLE AND NOT IN VIEWS WILL NOT BE SHOWN.
